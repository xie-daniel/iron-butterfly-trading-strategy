# iron-butterfly-trading-strategy
Strategy implementation and backtester for the iron butterfly options trading strategy, used on 3 months of SPX options data. Found a weak-moderate negative correlation between iron butterfly profit and VIX (an indicator for volatility in the S&amp;P 500), as expected.
